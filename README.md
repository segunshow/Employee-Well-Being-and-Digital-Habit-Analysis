# Employee-Well-Being-and-Digital-Habit-Analysis

This Power BI dashboard project explores how employee well-being, productivity, and digital habits interact in a workplace setting. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and this analysis was conducted as part of my data analytics learning journey at Vephla University.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to visualize and analyze how various factors — such as job type, sleep hours, social media usage, perceived vs actual productivity, and offline time — affect employee stress levels and satisfaction.

The dashboard was developed using Power BI, where I cleaned, modeled, and visualized the dataset to uncover hidden patterns and actionable insights.

Key Observations
A large portion of employees are getting fewer than seven hours of sleep per night, indicating poor rest quality across the workforce.

There is a mismatch between perceived productivity scores and actual productivity, suggesting possible issues with self-assessment or measurement frameworks.

Certain job roles show consistently higher stress levels and more reported burnout days per month.

Higher social media usage correlates with lower job satisfaction and increased stress levels.

Employees spending less time offline or taking fewer breaks are more likely to report high stress and burnout symptoms.

Recommendations
Encourage healthier sleep habits among employees to promote better focus and productivity.

Reassess how productivity is tracked and communicated to align perception with actual output.

Provide extra support to high-stress job categories through resources or adjusted workloads.

Promote digital balance by reducing unnecessary screen time during work hours.

Encourage regular breaks and offline hours to improve mental wellness and reduce burnout risk.
